# Legacy Directory

This directory contains old scripts and notebooks that are no longer actively used in the current project workflow.

## Purpose

The files in this directory represent previous versions, experimental approaches, or deprecated implementations that have been superseded by newer, more refined solutions. They are kept for reference purposes and historical documentation.

## Contents

### `FT_CLIP-14.ipynb`

This notebook contains an older implementation of fine-tuning CLIP-14 on the Oxford Pet dataset. While it may contain valuable insights or alternative approaches, it has been replaced by more current implementations in the main project directory.

## Usage

⚠️ **Warning**: These files are provided for reference only and may not work with current dependencies or project structure. They are not maintained or updated.

If you need to work with the current implementation, please refer to the main project directory for the latest versions of the notebooks and scripts.

## Why Legacy?

Files are moved to this directory when:

- They are superseded by improved implementations
- They serve as historical reference for the project's evolution

## Recommendations

- Use these files for learning and understanding the project's development history
- Do not rely on them for current development work
- Always check the main project directory for the most up-to-date implementations
