# Models Directory

This directory contains the implementations of the three models that were used during the competition day to achieve the reported results.

## Models Included

- **CLIP/**: Implementation of the CLIP model used in the competition
- **EfficientNet/**: Implementation of the EfficientNet model used in the competition
- **ResNet/**: Implementation of the ResNet model used in the competition

## Purpose

These model implementations replicate the exact results obtained on the day of the competition for the three models considered. Each model folder contains the necessary code and configurations to reproduce the performance metrics and outcomes achieved during the competition.
